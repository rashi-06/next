          These days my waves get lost in the oceans
          Seven billion swimmers, man I&apos;m going through the motions
          Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
          Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
          Maybe I should try to find the old me
          Take me to the places and the people that know me
          Tryin&apos; to disconnect, thinking maybe you could show me
          If there&apos;s so many people here, then why am I so lonely?
